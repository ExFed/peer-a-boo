# Peer-a-Boo 👻

A web-based P2P baby monitor using WebRTC.

## Features

- **Baby Station**: Streams video/audio from the device. Generates a QR code for
  easy pairing.
- **Parent Station**: Connects to the Baby Station to monitor.
- **P2P**: Direct connection using PeerJS (no video server required).
- **Wake Lock**: Prevents devices from sleeping while monitoring.

## How to Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

### Optional: HTTPS Dev Server

Some browsers require HTTPS even during development when you access the app
from another device on your network. Use the HTTPS helper script when you need
to test WebRTC from phones or tablets on the same LAN.

1. Run the secure dev server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:https
   ```

2. On the first run the script creates `certs/dev.cert.pem` and
  `certs/dev.key.pem`. Trust the certificate in your OS keychain if you want to
  remove browser warnings.
3. Visit `https://localhost:5173` (or the LAN IP of your machine) and accept
  the certificate warning if it appears.
4. Repeat the command whenever you need HTTPS; the existing certificate will be
  reused automatically.

#### Share to Other Devices

When another device on your network needs to load the dev server, expose Vite
on all interfaces:

```bash
npm run dev:https -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

Replace `dev:https` with `dev` if you only need HTTP. Visit
`https://<your-lan-ip>:5173` (or `http://` if not using HTTPS) from the other
device and accept the certificate warning when prompted.

## How to Use

1. **Baby Station**:
    - Open the app on the device you want to leave with the baby (e.g., Laptop).
    - Click "I am the Baby Station".
    - Allow camera/microphone access.
    - A QR code and Room identifier will appear.

2. **Parent Station**:
    - Open the app on your monitoring device (e.g., Phone).
    - **Option A**: Scan the QR code from the Baby Station.
    - **Option B**: Click "I am the Parent Station" and manually enter the Room
      identifier displayed on the Baby Station.
    - Click "Connect".

## Deployment (Important for Mobile)

To use this on a mobile phone (Parent Station) connecting to a laptop (Baby
Station), you **must** deploy this to a secure HTTPS host (like GitHub Pages,
Vercel, or Netlify).

**Why?** Browsers block Camera/Microphone access on insecure (HTTP) origins,
except for `localhost`. Since your phone cannot access `localhost` on your
laptop, you need a public HTTPS URL.

### Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push this code to a GitHub repository.
2. Go to the repository **Settings** > **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
4. The included workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will automatically
   build and deploy the app to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`.

### Deploy to Netlify/Vercel

1. Run `npm run build`.
2. Upload the `dist` folder to your hosting provider.
